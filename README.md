# EyeMouseControl-Python-
EyeMouseControl is a Python code project that enables you to control your mouse cursor using your eyes. This innovative solution utilizes computer vision techniques and eye-tracking algorithms to interpret eye movements and translate them into precise mouse movements on the screen.

With EyeMouseControl, you can enjoy a hands-free and intuitive mouse control experience, making it especially useful for individuals with physical disabilities or anyone seeking a novel and convenient way to interact with their computer. The code leverages Python libraries such as OpenCV and dlib to detect and track eye movements, providing accurate and responsive control over the mouse cursor.

Features:

1.Eye tracking: The code utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track eye movements, allowing for precise cursor control.
2. Calibration: EyeMouseControl includes a calibration process that ensures accurate mapping between eye movements and cursor movements, tailored to individual users.
3. Mouse functionality: The code enables left-click, right-click, and scrolling actions through eye movements, providing a comprehensive mouse control experience.
4. Customizability: EyeMouseControl offers flexibility for customization, allowing users to adjust parameters and fine-tune the system based on their preferences and needs.
5. User-friendly interface: The code includes a user-friendly interface that provides real-time feedback on eye movements, simplifying the calibration process and enhancing the overall user experience.
6. Whether you're looking to explore new human-computer interaction methods or seeking an alternative mouse control solution, EyeMouseControl offers a reliable and accessible codebase to get started. Join us in revolutionizing the way we interact with computers using the power of our eyes.
